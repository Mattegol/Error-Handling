# Exception Handling Good Practice

## Do not add a catch block that does nothing or just rethrows.
Catch block should add some value.

May just be to log the error.

Usually bad practice to ignore(swallow/trap) exceptions.

## Do not use exceptions for normal program flow logic.
E.g input validation
  - You expect input to invalid sometimes
  - Not an exceptional situation
  - Part of expected logic flow
  
IsValid(xxx) method(s)

## Design code to avoid exceptions
int Parse(string input) could instead be bool TryParse(string input, out int result)

Consider returning null (o null object pattern) for extremely common errors

## Use correct grammar in exception messages
Correct punctuation

Correct spelling

End sentences with full stop

Consider error message localization
